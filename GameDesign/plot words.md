# Chapter 1

# At the beginning of this game:

## The stuxnet is attacking the country. The final battle is coming. The main role is staying in crystal center to instill his magic power into it to sustain the magic bound to defend the enemies.

Talking to the king Lewis 13: 

The king Lewis: Hi, my son. Although the Stuxnet is very powerful, I believe we are bound to defeat it if our people join force togeth.

I: Ok, father. I will try my best to defend the magic crystal center and fight until the final second.

Talking to the brother:

The brother: Hi, my litter brother. We will stand in front of you during this battle. You just need to do your own job.

Taling to the sister:

the sister: The enemy is very powerful. There is a tough battle waiting for us.

## Then I come to magic crystal center. Control the magic to attcak the enemy army. After a short period of time, Geralt came in hurrily with flustered expression. 

Geralt: My prince! My prince!

I: What happend? Geralt? Why do you so hurry?

Geralt: Give up this place and run away quickly! The king was defeated by the Stuxnet and they are comming!

I: What? How can my powerful father be deafeated by Stuxnet? This couldn't happen!

Geralt: The stuxnet has the power that restrains our crystal magic, so that the king can't hurt it!

## Then a group of enemies can in. 

Geralt: My prince. We must defeat these enemies to escape. Now hand your weapon and then I will teach you how to fight.

I: I can't wait to defeat these ugly enemies and kick them out of my country!

## Here start the novice guidance about how to fight. After defeating these enemies. The Stuxnet appeared.

Geralt: Run away! My Prince. I will impede it as possible as i can! Just run away!

Stuxnet: So weak. All human are like ants. (It then casually attacked Geralt. Geralt fell down in ruins, unkown for dead or alive)

Stuxnet(turn to I): Now its your turn. (Put up hands slowly)

I: No! Geralt? My gold, will i just die here?

## Then a light beam shroud the main character. The main character disappeared in the air. And Stuxnet's attack missed.


# Chapter 2

## The main role wake up slowly

I(open the eye and look around, here is a strange room): What happened? Where am I?

## Then a cute girl come in the bedroom, with some food in her hand. 

The cute girl: Hi, how do you feel now? 

I: Who are you? And where am I? I remember i was just facing the Stuxnet.

The cute girl: Ai? Sorry, i forgot to introduce my name. My name is Moly. You are very safe now. Because my grandfather saved you under the attack of the stuxnet.

I: Wait a minute. I just remenbered a beam of light covered me....

Moly: Yes. that is a type of Tranfer Magic. The Magic transferred you from the magic empire world to this world. By the way, this world is called 'Blend'.

I: So your grandfather saved me? I want to say very thank you to him. But why did him saved me?

Moly: The reason is a little complex.. You'd better ask him on your own. Now, I want you to just rest and recover your body.

### I sleep again, may be after a several hours, an old man came in. I wake up.

The old man: Gald to see you, i am moly's grandfather, merlin, a magician.

I: Hello, Merlin, thank you for saving me, but why? 

Merlin: I have a prophetic crystal, i can see a corner of furture on it, you are the only one who can defeat the stuxnet now.

I: Me? Why? I can't do anything in front of the stuxnet at all. I even can't hurt it. Grand Merlin, since you can save me from the stuxnet, i think you must be far powerful than me.

Merlin: Sad to say. I was once defeated by the stuxnet. In order to save from the attack of the stuxnet, i lose all my power and my lengendary equipment. The magic i used to save you is the last life saving means i can use because this magic across the worlds. At now, i am just a common old man and can't do anyting.

I: That's a very bad news. Your crystal said i can defeat the stuxnet, but i am so weak now.

Merlin: Don't worry. I will help you. If you succeed to get my lengendary equipment back and use them, plus your talent, you can have the chance to defeat the stuxnet. Moly will tell me how to do it.

Moly: Now, my hero, first let me tell the basic of this world. This world is called 'Blend', which is the world also invaded by the stuxnet. Once we tried to defend it, but as you can see, my grandfather, this world's most powerful magician also failed. After that, this world's creature become affected by the stuxnet. Most of them became more ferocious and eager to attack human. 

I: So it is very dangerous outside? right? 

Moly: Yes, i recommend you to be very careful when outside. And just as my grandfather said, you need to get his equipment back. They are 
Merlin shoes, Merlin Gown and Merlin Wand, which are guarded by the bodyguards of the stuxnet. They are all also very powerful. We can't defeat them because we are too weak.

I: I have known i am very weak now, do you know how can i be powerful enough?

Moly: Since the world is corrupted, the outside is very dangerous. But it is also a very good chance to make you stornger. Fighting with the monsters outside and facing the hopeless situation will definitely make you stronger and have the power to fight with the stuxnet. 

I: Since i am the only one who can save my world, i will try my best. 

Moly: Ok. We are in a shelter. Here is all walks of people, who can give support for you. And if you want to go to outside world, just use the transport matrix. 

I: OK.

### Then I can walk around in this shelter. There are many people.

Talking to Eden(Pharmacist): Hi, are you the new here? I can do transaction with you. Just need some gold.(A. Transaction(40 gold each) B. leave)

Talking to Alex(Hammersmith): Oh, hello, my Warrior? I have best craftsmanship here, do you want to try?(A. Upgrade Card(80 gold once) B. leave)

Talking to Simith(Businessman): Look at my goods! There must be something you need! (A. refresh(50gold)   B. leave)

Talking to Moly: Don't worry about the fight, i will go with you to give you the best support.

Talking to Merlin: Sorry, i can't give more help in your future fight. But i will pray for your success.

### Then you can go to original forest => robot empire => Dragon Cave => Dark castle (3 guradian, 3 boss battle) => Orginal world.


## After defeating the 3 guradian and get Merlin's equipment back.

I: Merlin, i have got your equipment back. But i think i can't defeat the stuxnet just using them. 

Merlin: Don't worry about that. Since you have defeated the 3 guardian, i have the chance to study on the origin and weakness of the stuxnet. Just give me serveral days, and i will try to exert my magic which can do damage to the stuxnet on them so that you can have the chance to defeat the stuxnet. 

I: Ok, i will wait for the best preparation.


## After 7 days. Merlin walked out of his room and he handed these equipment to you. 

Merlin: I have tried my best to reform these equipment in order to deal damage to the stuxnet. There is serveral runes on it (console.log(error), ctl+C, try catch ...). You are bound to have the chance to defeat the stuxnet using these equipment!

I: Oh, really? I can't wait to fight with it.

Merlin: If you are ready to do the final battle, you can talk to me. And I will transfer you to your original world.

### I am free to look around in the shelter. And now i can try to kill Eden(Pharmacist) Alex(Hammersmith) Simith(Businessman) to get all their things. (Eden: add 2 potion bags and you can get many potions, Alex:upgrade all your cards, Simith: get 3 lengendary cards) If you do that, although you can be stronger, you will come to the bad ending.

## Chapter 3

## Moly and I come back to the original world. The wolrd is all destroyed. You can see ruins and bodies everywhere, as well as many monsters. I go straight toward my castle. There is no life in this castle. The stuxnet is just sitting on the throne. I feel very angry. Then come into the fight.

Bad ending: Because you kill the innocent people and possess all their things, you defeat the stuxnet easily. However, your soul was corrupted. You are immersed in the power, the power of dead stuxnet went into your body. 

I: Giao! HHHHHHH, this is the beauty of power! I can't wait to destroy a world to test my power!

Good ending: You and the stuxnet are 55å¼€, you want to give up your own life to kill the stuxnet. However, Moly came out to use her body to guard you. Then your attack killed the stuxnet.

Moly: I have helped you.... I am gald to help you a little in this battle.

I: No! Moly!

### Moly has no breath.

After this battle. I convene the survived people together to rebuild the hometown. And I build a statue of Moly in front of the castle to remember the contribution of Moly and the people gave a hand to me. Finally, the empire restore its original appearance. All people have led a happy life.
